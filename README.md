# Zilch Snippets and Libraries
This repository contains Code Snippets, Libraries and Example projects created by me (Johannes Peter) with DigiPen's Proprietary *<a href=zero.digipen.edu>Zero Engine</a>*.

Most of the code will be written in <a href=http://zero.digipen.edu/Zilch.html>Zilch</a> (Zero's scripting language).

## Contents
* **<a href=https://github.com/JohannesMP/Zilch-Snippets-and-Libraries/tree/master/Experimentals>Experimentals</a>**
  * Somewhat complete, possibly buggy projects, generally designed to explore a given idea, concept or feature in Zero.
  * Generally won't be well commented or cleanly structured
* **<a href=https://github.com/JohannesMP/Zilch-Snippets-and-Libraries/tree/master/Libraries>Libraries</a>**
  * Complete (hopefully) bug-free libraries that I've cleaned up and commented for general use.
* **<a href=https://github.com/JohannesMP/Zilch-Snippets-and-Libraries/tree/master/Snippets>Snippets</a>**
  * Like Experimentals, just smaller.
