# Zilch Snippets and Libraries
Contains code snippets, libraries and example projects, shared here as a resource for other DigiPen students.

Most of the code is designed to be used with DigiPen's *<a href=zero.digipen.edu>Zero Engine</a>* and will be written in <a href=http://zero.digipen.edu/Zilch.html>Zilch</a> (Zero's scripting language).

As of this writing, Zero is only available to DigiPen students.



## Contents

  * Somewhat complete, possibly buggy projects, generally designed to explore a given idea, concept or feature in Zero.
  * Generally won't be well commented or cleanly structured
* **<a href=https://github.com/JohannesMP/Zilch-Snippets-and-Libraries/tree/master/Libraries>Libraries</a>**
  * Complete (hopefully) bug-free libraries that I've cleaned up and commented for general use.
* **<a href=https://github.com/JohannesMP/Zilch-Snippets-and-Libraries/tree/master/Snippets>Snippets</a>**
  * Like Experimentals, just smaller.
