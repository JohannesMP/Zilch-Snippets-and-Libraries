I created the original Space tracker experimental because, at the time,
Zero had no way to iterate over all existing spaces.

It consisted of:
1. A `SpaceUpdateSender` component that was added to the default space archetype.
- It was set up to send an event with its space's name on init and destroy.
2. A `SpaceTracker` component that was added to the gamesession
- It listened to the SpaceUpdateSender events, and used them to maintain an array of spaces.
- That array could easily be queried and iterated over to list all existing spaces.

However soon after I created the experimental, Zero added a native solution.
`GameSession.AllSpaces` can now be iterated over for all current spaces.

Since this experimental was not particularly interesting I removed it.
If you really want to mess with it, just roll back to commit a68ad41319
