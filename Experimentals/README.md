# Experimentals

These are various Zero Projects created for the sake of exploring a specific feature or concept. They are in varying states of completion/buggyness and should be used at your own risk.

* Using JDebug to draw some ballistic arcs that take gravity and drag into account
* Features various parameters that you can modify via keyboard with on-screen instructions

This was a fun exploration of properly pre-predicting physics for debug purposes. Special thanks to Rob for his physics insights and getting the simulated arc physics to exactly match up with those of the actual engine.

I may expand on this later with a general library that takes delegates as an argument, allowing you to do fun things like accurately draw the path a particle would take through a gravity/vector field.
