Controls:

   1 / 2  : The length of the arc that is simulated.
   [ / ]  : The number of alternate arcs simulated (rotated about the z axis)
   - / =  : Change gravity (will not affect the cube's position)
   , / .  : Change drag    (will not affect the cube's position)
   ; / '  : Change arc resolution (how many line segments are drawn)
       T  : Toggle Arc Vertex (highest point) indicator
       P  : Pause Cube
