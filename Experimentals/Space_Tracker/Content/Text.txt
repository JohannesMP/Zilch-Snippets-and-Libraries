This Project deals with tracking spaces as they are created/removed.

By default, there is no way to get an array/list of current spaces.

This Project adds the 'SpaceTracker' and 'SpaceUpdateSender' components.
- SpaceUpdateSender lives on the space archetype, and sends SpaceUpdate events.
- SpaceTracker lives on the gamesession, and receives SpaceUpdate events

SpaceTracker.SpaceArray contains all current spaces (should not be modified by user)
SpaceTracker.DebugDump() prints all current spaces and their levels to the console

- For examples see SpaceTest.z, which has several keys bound for testing.
