This demo illustrates the useage of the UIStateManager Component

   - When left clicking and holding the object, it gains the 'held' state.
        - the 'held' state is represented by a yellow color.

   - When right clicking the object loses its 'active' state
        - when inactive, the object no longer responds to input.

   - When left clicked successfully, the object's 'selected' status toggles.
        - When 'selected' the object is a circle, otherwise it is a square.

Notice how when clicking and dragging on the object, and letting go outside of it the selected status does not register, since it was not considered a valid click.
